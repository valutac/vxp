# VXP - Valutac Engineering Proposal
Engineering Proposal of Valutac

VXP stands for Valutac Engineering Proposals. An VXP is a document that details a specific technology decision being made by the Valutac Engineer.

# VXP Types

- A Process proposal describes a change to how the Valutac plaform functions.
- A Best Practices proposal describes a technology or implementation choice that the Valutac believes all Valutac services and/or libraries should use or follow.
- An Architecture proposal describes relationships between Valutac services and libraries, including their APIs and data formats.
